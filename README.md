Ultimate Docker Server
======================

**UDS** is a docker compose file that you can fire on your server that will automatically enable you to have:
- git server ([Gogs](https://github.com/gogits/gogs))
- CI and CD ([drone](https://github.com/drone/drone))
- web proxy & load balancer ([traefik](https://github.com/containous/traefik))
- chat server ([Rocket.Chat](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat))
- (*to be continued*)

## Getting started
Clone the repo and fire up `docker-compose`:
```shell
docker-compose up
```
